# tec-8x8 Matrix, 64 LED 2D Display

## Abstract

## Introduction 

## Literature Review

## TE-11-22
This is our first "add-on" for the TEC1. It is an array of 64 LEDs arranged in a matrix of 8 LEDs by 8 LEDs. Actually it has almost the same number of LEDs as the display on the TEC but in this design the LEDs are arranged in ROWS to create a very interesting display. The whole concept of the 8 x 8 matrix is to produce the equivalent of a WINDOW ON A VIDEO SCREEN.

Each LED represents one pixel and this will enable us to produce characters, letters and movement equal to 8 pixels by 8 pixels. This may be only a small fraction of the area of video screen but it is the best place to start. If you can produce effects and movement on a small scale, a full-size VDU screen is only an enlargement of our 'window'.  

If you have seen the advertising signs composed of thousands of LEDs or globes on which moving letters and characters are displayed, you will be interested to know the same effect can be produced with this project. Modules of the 8x8 display can be placed side-by-side to create a long display. The PC board is designed to be cut so that the pattern runs as a continuous display. At this stage it is not out intention to promote the extended display as it requires a slightly different driving circuit. To achieve a readable brightness with more than 8 columns of LEDs, it is necessary to introduce blocks of columns which are latched or even latching for each column. This will enable each LED to be turned on to full brightness and produce a bright display.
