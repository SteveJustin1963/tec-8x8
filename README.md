## TomyTronic 3D games
TomyTronic 3D is a range of games produced by Tomy in 1985. It was Tomy's first attempt to move into the then-popular world of 3D games. TomyTronic 3D was a game system similar to the Vectrex, in that it used a clear plastic overlay on the LCD screen of the game in order to provide a 3D effect. The games were played by holding the game system in your left hand and the controller in your right. The controller had a joystick on the left, and three buttons on the right, which were used to control the game. The games were designed to be played in short bursts, as they were intended to be played in arcades. The games were not very successful, and Tomy stopped production of the TomyTronic 3D system in 1986.

### Iterate
- POV
- Vectrex
- 16x16
- 8x8x8
- Stereoptic matrix, some early games used this, showing a series of lights coming at you giving the illusion of forward movement. inside that was a gun to shoot bullets forward to hit a moving target in the middle. 
- Stereoptic- POV; combining both to get cude 3d video!
