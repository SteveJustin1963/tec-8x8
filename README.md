# tec-8x8

An 8x8, 64 LED matrix, aka a simple pixel, 2D Display, presented in issue TE-11 pg 22.
- test each code example
- test game examples
- Use integrated 8x8 module instead of individual LEDs

### Iterate
- POV
- Vectrex
- 16x16
- 8x8x8
- 8x8x8
- alt lighting; neon, xenon, incandescent, laser, nixie, plasma, 
- stereoscopic 8x8 ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy, new code, game etc
- volumetric display ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_display, new code
- simple CRO
- Stereoptic matrix, some early games used this, showing a series of lights coming at you giving the illusion of forward movement. inside that was a gun to shoot bullets forward to hit a moving target in the middle. 
- Stereoptic- POV; combining both to get cude 3d video! 
- CHA-81 LED Chaser DIY Kit
- contrast or fade LED with freq control of multiplex
- convert to forth code
- output https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-EYE onto 8x8 with contrast
- output 2x tec-EYE into 2x 8x8 through stereoscopic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cardboard
- think about robot vision and depth perception code.
- TomyTronic 3D is a range of games produced by Tomy in 1985. It was Tomy's first attempt to move into the then-popular world of 3D games. TomyTronic 3D was a game system similar to the Vectrex, in that it used a clear plastic overlay on the LCD screen of the game in order to provide a 3D effect. The games were played by holding the game system in your left hand and the controller in your right. The controller had a joystick on the left, and three buttons on the right, which were used to control the game. The games were designed to be played in short bursts, as they were intended to be played in arcades. The games were not very successful, and Tomy stopped production of the TomyTronic 3D system in 1986. eg Space Laser Fight , 3D Star Fighter (1985), 3D Torpedo (1985)
